# LIT-TableTop-Version
A tabletop simulation testing advanced communication on a lunar-analog surface.
It evaluates WiFi 6 mesh networking with 5G backhaul, a WiFi 6 camera, lighting
systems, and USB sensor data retrieval. The project will also explore secure
local file transfers to an independent base station, offering valuable insights
for the future LIT project.
